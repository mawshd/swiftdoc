This kind of problem can be solved using compositional layout, to add more it allows you to add orthogonal behavior, e.g you have vertical listing for, specific section you need horizontal scrolling behavior, in normal layout\/flow layout you canâ€™t achieve this with single collection view, you have to add another horizontal collection inside collection view cell, so in a way you have to handle two collections.","type":"text"}],"url":"\/documentation\/cvflowlayouts\/compositevc","title":"CompositeVC","identifier":"doc:\/\/com.flowlayouts\/documentation\/CVFlowLayouts\/CompositeVC","fragments":[{"kind":"keyword","text":"class"},{"text":" ","kind":"text"},{"kind":"identifier","text":"CompositeVC"}],"kind":"symbol","type":"topic","role":"symbol","navigatorTitle":[{"text":"CompositeVC","kind":"identifier"}]}}}
